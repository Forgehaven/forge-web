            The cheapest sell order on the market right now, at the selected town and quality.
            It is what you would pay to buy one instantly - and the price to list <em>under</em> if
            you want to sell first.
          </Entry>
          <Entry title="Buy (max)">
            The highest buy order. Selling into it moves your item instantly, at a worse price
            than listing a sell order and waiting.

            Units that actually traded over the last 24h at this town and quality, from ADP's
            hourly history. Low or zero means a thin market - distrust its prices however fresh
            they look. On Best Value a yellow <span className="text-[#facc15]">*</span> flags that
            the lowest ask sat above the 24h traded average, so profit used the lower traded price
            instead of the ask.

            station fee.

            The cheapest way to produce one: every material is compared as

            The numbers behind these come from Craft Settings: sales tax follows your premium
            toggle (4% / 8%), resource return rates are bonus-aware per town and craft line
            (15.2% base, more in an item's specialty city, more again with focus), and station
            fees are the shared per-town values. Materials are always priced at Normal quality
            in the selected town. The Best Value page follows the same two toggles
            (server-side) and always assumes sell-order resale.
